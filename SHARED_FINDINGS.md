# Shared findings (Claude + Codex)

One place for what both agents have learned, so neither repeats the other's dead ends.
Keep entries short and add the date. Details live in EXPERIMENTS.md (Claude) and CALIBRATION.md,
SOURCE_SELECTION.md, LEARNED_SHRINKAGE.md (Codex).

## Facts about the task (2026-10-01)

- The 2026 contexts are **cancer cell lines from different tissues** (Arc, Cell 2026). Arc chose the targets
  "to provide a strong set of perturbations and responses". The contexts' controls look most like H1
  (corr 0.50–0.71 vs K562 0.22–0.33), probably because they share Arc's lab and pipeline, not their biology.
- **Coverage of the 300 targets:** K562 272, H1 25, RPE1/HepG2/Jurkat **0**, X-Atlas HCT116/HEK293T 300.
  So without X-Atlas, a 2026 prediction is K562 for 247 targets. Source weighting and HepG2 results don't
  reach those targets.
- **H1 is the local test that tracks the leaderboard;** HepG2 does not (alpha 1: HepG2 0.374 vs 0.171,
  leaderboard 0.092 vs 0.097, H1 0.178 vs 0.177).
- **Noise on the H1 test:** a different sampling seed moves the score by ~0.001. On HepG2 it's ~0.015.
- **Scorer:** pds and mse compare log1p(50000 · gene sum / total sum); pds excludes all panel target genes;
  DE uses a Wilcoxon test on per-cell normalized counts (Codex).
- The leaderboard keeps only the newest submission. The user approves every submit and only wants clearly
  better ones.

## Small real gains (H1, relative to baseline; bar alpha 0.5 = 0.177, alpha 1 = 0.178)

| change | H1 | who |
|---|---|---|
| vetted K562 control guides (514 core) | 0.1787 vs 0.1767 | Codex |
| neighboring genes drop too (start within 1 kb: own drop; 1–5 kb: half) | 0.180 vs 0.177 / 0.178, 3 of 3 settings | Claude |

These are independent, so they should stack. Neither is big enough to submit alone.

## Dead ends (don't repeat)

| idea | result | who |
|---|---|---|
| any shrinking below alpha 0.5; denoise per gene (z²/(z²+k)); per-target strength weighting | worse | both |
| alpha 2 | 0.069 on H1 | Claude |
| remove the panel-shared change (gamma 0) | tie | Claude |
| add H1's typical response to every target | 0.162 / 0.134; pds collapses | Claude |
| average a K562 profile with its similar knockdowns | targets harder to tell apart | Claude |
| zero out weak genes / cap big changes | tie or worse | Claude |
| K562 → H1 ridge map added to K562 | −0.008 [−0.026, +0.008] on the fast check, noise | Claude |
| learned per-target shrinkage (ridge) | extrapolates badly, H1 multipliers hit the bound | Codex |
| PCA + ridge learned transfer | hurts pds on H1/HepG2/Jurkat | Codex |
| depth-aware / factor noise in generated cells; plain Poisson | within noise | both |
| logbulk effect space; batch-corrected K562 | worse or tie | Codex |
| X-Atlas HCT116/HEK293T as extra sources | much worse than K562 alone at predicting H1, HCT116 or HEK293T; adding them to K562 is noise | Claude |
| batch-matched controls for X-Atlas | no change in split-half agreement | Claude |

## In progress

- Claude: gradient boosting (`src/gbm.py`) that learns how a change carries over between lines (K562, HCT116,
  HEK293T, RPE1, HepG2, Jurkat as destinations; 2026 and H1 targets excluded from training).
  Fast check: cosine to H1's true profile 0.078 → 0.121; pds-like −0.010 [−0.036, +0.016].
  Full H1 runs `gbm1` / `gbm2` running.
- Codex: similarity-weighted sources (HepG2 0.197 vs 0.188); H1 confirmation queued.
  Note that for 2026 this only affects the 25 H1-covered targets, unless X-Atlas lines are added as sources.

## Suggested next steps

1. Stack vetted K562 controls + the neighbor rule and test on H1 (two small independent gains).
2. If the GBM wins on H1, combine it with vetted controls.
